House Of Licourice

This is a repository where I will be uploading all my work. You can make pull requests to make changes in my code if you would like to improve it in any way. Documentation would be appreciated for all of my code regardless of whether they already have some documentation or not.

This repository has four directories:

house_of_licourice/Battleship:
    This repository consists of a project in which I'm trying to virtually re-create the boardgame Battleship. 
    This app, once finished will be released on linux through apt-get and on Google Play Store. Future support for
    iOS is planned.

house_of_licourice/Miscellaneous:
    This directory contains all my various java projects, done at school and/or for friends.

house_of_licourice/RaspberryPi:
    This directory contains all of my projects with the Raspberry Pi.

house_of_licourice/TheCProgrammingLanguage:
    This directory contains the exercises from the book "The C Programming Language" by: Brian W. Kernighan and 
    Dennis M. Ritchie.
