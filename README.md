House Of Licourice

This is a repository where I will be uploading all my work. You can make pull requests to make changes in my code if you would like to improve it in any way. 

I would appreciate if someone could design (and develop) a GUI for my code. Preferably themselves without using a generator, although any kind of GUI would be fine to start with.
