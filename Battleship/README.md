This directory contains various programs that are part of a project in which I try to re-create the 
famous Battleship board game.   

In Phase 1: The computer will randomly generate the coordinates of 4 battleships and you have to guess 
their location. 

In Phase 2: A connection is established between two players and each player sets their own battleships 
and have to guess the location of their opponent's battleships.

In Phase 3: You set your battleships and play against an aritificial intelligence.
